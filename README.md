## The Ideas

My initial Idea was to make an RPG inspired game through Python, I spent a long time on it, but realised there was too much that I had planned in the time-frame I had.

Instead I changed over to a quiz style instead. I came up with this idea because I enjoy the comic book genre, specifically Deadpool, and think that others would too if they saw how complex of a character he is.

I had a rough idea of how I was going to do this, compared to having limited ideas on the original RPG story telling game.
This made it easier to start and also made writing the correct code a little bit easier in the beginning.

## How To Play
-   The Idea of the quiz is quite simple and because I was limited with design features, compared to the previous projects with HTML and CSS. The way to play is very easy to understand and is also explained at the start of the game.

    You have multiple choice answers to questions revolving around deadpool.
    Each time the user makes a choice, they will be informed everytime they input a possible answer.
    At the end of the quiz, the game will then tell you out of percent (%), how well you did.
    I like this percentage feature as it makes it easier for me to add to it or change the quiz around later on.
